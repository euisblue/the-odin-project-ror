# Caesar Cipher 

A Ruby project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/sub-strings)

> Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

{"down"=>1, "go"=>1, "going"=>1, "how"=>2, "howdy"=>1, "it"=>2, "i"=>3, "own"=>1, "part"=>1, "partner"=>1, "sit"=>1}
