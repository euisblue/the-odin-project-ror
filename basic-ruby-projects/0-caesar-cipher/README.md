# Caesar Cipher 

A Ruby project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/caesar-cipher)

The goal is to implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor.

The original project only asks for the encoding, but I added decoding part as well since codes are similar.

```txt
1) Encode      2) Decode      0) Quit
> 1
Enter a message.
> Hello, World!
Shift by..
> 17
======================
Yvccf, Nficu!
======================
 1) Encode      2) Decode      0) Quit

Enter a message.

```
